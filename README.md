<h2> Background </h2>
<br>
A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. There are two types of Perceptrons: Single layer and Multilayer. Single layer Perceptrons can learn only linearly separable patterns. This implementation of the single layer perceptron can train on a given dataset and then predict class labels of unseen data.
